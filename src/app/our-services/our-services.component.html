                Roof gardening serves as a natural shield against the harsh effects of sun heat by providing an
                additional layer of insulation to buildings. The greenery on rooftops acts as a barrier, absorbing and
                deflecting sunlight, thereby reducing the amount of heat that penetrates into living spaces. The plants,
                through a process known as transpiration, release moisture into the air, creating a cooling effect and
                mitigating the intensity of solar radiation.

        <article>
            <p>These watering methods are very efficient, slowly applying water to vegetables and ornamental gardens.
                Soil moisture can be maintained at a level most suitable for plant uptake. If properly installed and
                maintained, little water is lost to evaporation or runoff, and water use can be reduced by up to 50
                percent.</p>

        <article>
            <p>For many situations, the expense of installing a good trickle irrigation system will be compensated by

            <h2 class="title">Use the Best Watering Method</h2><br>
            <p>While soils vary greatly in their ability to hold water, your garden and lawn should receive enough water
                to wet the soil to the bottom of the root zone each time you water—generally 1 inch per week. Determine
                this by digging a hole 5 to 6 inches deep in the watered area the day after watering so the water has a
                chance to seep in. Adjust weekly watering to your soil needs.</p>
        </article><br><br>

                    <p>It often wastes water as there is excess runoff, and water does not penetrate beyond the top 1
                        inch
                        of
                        soil. This irrigation practice harms plants by forcing root growth too close to the surface. If
                        you
                        must
                        water by hand, place a 5-gallon bucket with a few holes in the bottom next to the plant and fill
                        it
                        with

                        effective means of watering turfgrass. Be sure to position sprinklers to shower areas of
